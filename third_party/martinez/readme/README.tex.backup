\section{Comparative of algorithms for computing Boolean operations}

If you want to compare the execution times of the different implemented algorithms do the following:

\begin{verbatim}
$ make
$ ./clip file_subject file_clipping file_result [I|U|D]
\end{verbatim}

\noindent where:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \verb+file_subject+ is the file containing the subject polygon
 \item \verb+file_clipping+ is the file containing the clipping polygon
 \item \verb+file_result+ will be used to save the result of the operation
 \item the last parameter is optional and indicates the kind of Boolean operation:
   \begin{itemize}
    \item I stands for Intersection (the default operation)
    \item U stands for Union
    \item D stands for Difference between the subject and clipping polygons
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Format of polygon files}
You can find polygons in the directories \textit{polygons} and \textit{worldmap}. In the first directory you will find polygons up to 10000 vertices. In the 
\textit{worldmap} directory you will 
find a worldmap polygon with 76696 vertices. We suggest to try:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ./clip worldmap/worldmap worldmap/worldmap_moved_5_units_upward_and_rightward /dev/null
\end{verbatim}

You can also create your own polygons. A file polygon is an ASCII file with the following structure:

\begin{verbatim}
<number of contours>
<number of vertices of first contour> <level of first contour>
<vertex-list of first contour>
<number of vertices of second contour> <level of second contour>
<vertex-list of second contour>
...
\end{verbatim}

The level field is not used in this implementation, but you must include it. Next, you can see the content of the file \textit{polygonwithtwocontours}, that belongs
 to the directory \textit{polygons}:

\begin{verbatim}
2
3 1
	0.1 0.1
	0.3 0.1
	0.2 0.3
3 1
	0.6 0.1
	0.8 0.1
	0.7 0.3
\end{verbatim}

Contours can be described in clockwise or counterclockwise order.

\section{Rendering the result of Boolean operations}

If you want to render the result of a Boolean operation you should have installed glut and opengl and type:

\begin{verbatim}
$ make -f makefile.guiglut
$ ./guiglut file_subject file_clipping G|V|M [I|U|D]
\end{verbatim}

\noindent where,

\begin{itemize}
 \item \verb+file_subject+ is the file containing the subject polygon
 \item \verb+file_clipping+ is the file containing the clipping polygon
 \item the third parameter indicates the kind of algorithm used to compute the Boolean operation
   \begin{itemize}
     \item G stands for Greiner-Hormann
     \item V stands for Alan Murta's implementation of Vatti's algorithm
     \item M stands for our algorithm
   \end{itemize}
 \item the last parameter is optional, and indicates the kind of Boolean operation
   \begin{itemize}
     \item I stands for Intersection (the default operation)
     \item U stands for Union
     \item D stands for set the Difference subject-clipping polygons
   \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Note that when you run the program you can see the subject and clipping polygons. The subject polygon is shaded green, while the clipping
polygon is rendered as translucent red. You can type the following keys:

\begin{itemize}
 \item R: for toggling on/off rendering the result of the operation
 \item S: for toggling on/off rendering the subject polygon.
 \item C: for toggling on/off rendering the clipping polygon.
 \item W: for switching rendering the polygons from filled to wireframe.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation files}

You can take a look to the implementation of the algorithms. Greiner and Hormann's algorithm is implemented in the greiner.h and greiner.cpp file.
The implementation does not support the degenerate case of a vertex lying on an edge of the other polygon. We have not neither extended the algorithm
to compute the union and difference operation on polygons with several contours (the intersection can be computed).

We have included the Alan Murta's implementation of Vatti's algorithm (files gpc.h and gpc.cpp). Please, note that this code has its own
license (included in the file gpc.cpp). Alan Murta's implementation is very robust, it includes extensions to the algorithm to deal with edges parallel to the sweep line, and to deal with overlapping edges.

Finally, the implementation of our algorithm can be found in the files martinez.h and martinez.cpp.

\section{Polygons with several components and with holes}

Suppose two polygons such that both polygons have one single component and neither of the polygons has a hole. The result of a Boolean operation on the two polygons can be a polygon 
with several components and/or with holes. For these polygons, the algorithm described in the paper ``A new algorithm for computing Boolean operations on polygons'' computes correctly
the different components and holes of the Boolean operation. However, the algorithm does not compute the topological information describing which holes lie whithin which components---contours. In
order to compute this information I have developed the member function \lstinline+computeHoles+ of the class \lstinline+Polygon+. This function also gives an
orientation---clockwise or counterclockwise---to the different components---contours---taking into account the component depth. The following program shows how the 
\lstinline+computeHoles+ member function can be used:

\begin{lstlisting}
int main ()
{
   Polygon p ("polygons/polygonwithholes");
   cout << "Number of contours: " << p.ncontours () << '\n';
   cout << "Number of vertices: " << p.nvertices () << '\n';
   p.computeHoles ();
   // show information
   for (int i = 0; i < p.ncontours (); i++) {
      cout << "--- new contour ---\n";
      cout << "Identifier: " << i << '\n';
      cout << (p.contour (i).external () ? "External" : "Internal") << " contour\n";
      cout << "Orientation: " << (p.contour (i).clockwise () ? "clockwise" : "counterclockwise") 
           << '\n';
      cout << "Holes identifiers: ";
      for (int j = 0; j < p.contour (i).nholes (); j++)
         cout << p.contour (i).hole (j) << "  ";
      cout << '\n';
      cout << "Vertices: ";
      for (int j = 0; j < p.contour (i).nvertices (); j++)
         cout << p.contour (i).vertex (j) << "  ";
      cout << '\n';
   }
   return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The \lstinline+computeHoles+ function makes a second plane sweep in order to compute the holes associated to each contour. Its execution time is $O(n \log n)$, where $n$
is the number of edges of the polygon---of all its contours. Although, the \lstinline+computeHoles+ function is quite efficient the computation of holes can be
integrated in the \lstinline+Connector+ class in order to make a single plane sweep---I hope to program this in the future.

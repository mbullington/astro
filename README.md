# astro-wasm

Experimental geospatial library modeled after [Turf.js](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf) written in C/WASM.

This project is part of my PSU Schreyer Undergraduate Thesis under [Danfeng Zhang](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~dbz5017/), which looks to benchmark and document the performance characteristics of a WASM implemention vs. JS along with GeoJSON decoding/reencoding between JS-WASM.

## Progress

Right now I'm implementing different algorithms and assessing their performance vs. Turf.js:

- [x] `area`
- [ ] `union` - Implemented but needs unit tests for correctness.
- [ ] `intersect` - Implemented but needs unit tests for correctness.
- [ ] `difference` - Implemented but needs unit tests for correctness.

So far with small-`n` polygons, TURF.js is beating the WASM implementation by consistently ~1,000 ops per second. Next steps here are to build out the bench to test different `n` complexity of polygons and average them.

Also looking into WASM performance tools to avoid optimizing in the wrong places.

Experimental geospatial library modeled after [Turf.js](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf) written in C/WASM.

This project is part of my PSU Schreyer Undergraduate Thesis under [Danfeng Zhang](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~dbz5017/), which looks to benchmark and document the performance characteristics of a WASM implemention vs. JS along with GeoJSON decoding/reencoding between JS-WASM.
